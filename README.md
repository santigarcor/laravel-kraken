# laravel-kraken
A composer package for the Kraken PHP API which supports the Laravel 5
framework.

## Composer Installation
The best way to install laravel-kraken is with [Composer](<https://getcomposer.org/>).

To install the most recent version, run the following command.

`$ php composer.phar require santigarcor/laravel-kraken`

Alternatively, you may edit your composer.son directly by adding the following
to the require section.
```
"require": {
    "santigarcor/laravel-kraken": "^1.0",

folder. In this file you will need to insert your api key and api secret.

`$ php artisan vendor:publish

## Usage
Be sure to `use KrakenIO;` in your code

Then you can simply:
```
$response = KrakenIO::url([
    'url' => 'http://url-to-image.com/file.jpg',
    'wait' => true,
]);
```
